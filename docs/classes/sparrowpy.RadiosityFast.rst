Radiosity fast
--------------

This class represents an optimized radiosity implementation. It includes
the following features:

- It is optimized for speed
- It supports various forms and relationships of patches
- It supports :py:mod:`BRDFs<sparrowpy.brdf>`

It is now possible to load geometries in this class from `Blender <https://www.blender.org/>` or STL files.
We recommend you see how this is done in our :ref:`example<geom_loading_from_file>`, which includes some important details about import options.
