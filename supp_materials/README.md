# Supplementary materials
This folder containts the supplementary materials for the article Fatela, J., Heimes, A., Vorländer, M., Massimiliano, M. and Maffei, L. (2025). “Acoustic radiosity simulation with custom bidirectional reflectance distribution implementation in 3-D.", Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, **?**, 2025, **?**, pp. **?**.

Getting Started
===============
These materials contain a set of jupyter notebooks which document the step-by-step simulations used to achieve the results of the application examples described in the paper. The prefixes of the notebook examples map to the relevant paper sections. 

We recommend running these examples step by step, and getting acquainted with the simulation. **Only in the original conditions can the authors guarantee consistency with the paper's results.**
However, we encourage the user to use these files to experiment with their own setup, simulation, or approach.

### [``V_infinite_diffuse_plane.ipynb``](V_infinite_diffuse_plane.ipynb)
This example details the simulation performed in Section V of the paper, where an "infinite" diffuse reflecting plane is simulated. The accuracy of this simulation is assessed by comparison with the results put forth by [Svensson and Savioja, 2020](https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article-abstract/156/6/3788/3324169/The-Lambert-diffuse-reflection-model-revisited?redirectedFrom=fulltext).

### [``VIA_triangular_facade.ipynb``](VIA_triangular_facade.ipynb)
This example lays out the different steps of the retro-reflective façade simulation described in Section VI.A of the paper.

### [``VIB_street_canyon_plots.ipynb``](VI_street_canyon_plots.ipynb)
This notebook plots the figures in Section VI.B of the paper. These figures describe the simulation of a street canyon. The example is divided into two main sections:

1. The plotting of the energetic decay relative to a scene with complex scattering walls, in a retro-reflective source-receiver setup. Different scattering modeling approaches are compared and a ray-tracing simulation reference is also plotted. This data can be generated by the user in notebook [``VIB1_street_canyon_decay.ipynb``](ASDF)
    - **NOTE:** The simulation files for the generation of the ray-tracing data are not provided in these materials. They can be made available upon reasonable request to the authors. 

2. The plotting of the computational performance measures as a function

### [``VIB1_street_canyon_decay.ipynb``](VIB_street_canyon_decay.ipynb)
This example lays out the different steps of the simulation of the ETC of a street canyon with a retro-reflective setup, as described in section VI.B.1 of the paper.

### A note on the simulation datasets
By default, all examples run with the datasets used in the paper. However, you can run the examples based on your own simulation results: by changing the variable ``self_data=True``, the examples will pick the results of your previously simulated data. This option is highlighted in the beginning of each relevant document.

Note that some errors may occur, if the simulation output dependencies are not respected. If you decide to run the examples on your own results:
- [``App_BRDF_generation.ipynb``](App_BRDF_generation.ipynb) must be run before [``VIA_triangular_facade.ipynb``](VIA_triangular_facade.ipynb) and [``VIB1_street_canyon_decay.ipynb``](VIB_street_canyon_decay.ipynb) 
    - In order to generate the relevant scattering distributions in the form of BRDF.
- [``VIB1_street_canyon_decay.ipynb``](VIB_street_canyon_decay.ipynb) and [``VIB2_street_canyon_performance.ipynb``](VIB_street_canyon_performance.ipynb) must be run before [``VIB_street_canyon_plots.ipynb``](VIB_street_canyon_decay.ipynb)
    - The infinite plane ETC and performance metrics are stored in local files for convenience. The plotting routines then access said files.
