Python Boilerplate contains all the boilerplate you need to create a Python package.

Getting Started
===============

Follow our [example notebooks](https://github.com/sparrow-acoustics/sparrowpy/tree/main/examples) to get a sense of the structure and functions of sparrowpy.

Installation
============

Use pip to install sparrowpy

    pip install sparrowpy

(Requires Python >= 3.9)

if numba is installed the code will be precompiled and will run faster. We strongly recommend to use numba to accelerate the simulations significantly

    pip install sparrowpy[fast]

or

    pip install sparrowpy
    pip install numba

Geometry import via blender or STL files will be supported in a future release, an install of the Blender API. Note that blender has strong requirements on the python version, see [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/bpy/). You can install it via pip

    pip install bpy

to show progress bars install tqdm

    pip install tqdm

by default these packages are not installed

Audio file reading/writing is supported through [SoundFile](https://python-soundfile.readthedocs.io), which is based on
[libsndfile](http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/). On Windows and OS X, it will be installed automatically.
On Linux, you need to install libsndfile using your distributionâ€™s package manager, for example ``sudo apt-get install libsndfile1``.
If the installation fails, please check out the [help section](https://pyfar-gallery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/help).
